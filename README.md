## Cogo
Ideally is in COGO side they will send `POST` request with their data, can be done through fetch; and after that they redirect back to our marketplace url

## Brighte Marketplace
Ideally we consume what they provide through cookies (i havent yet figured out if theres another way as usually sending data to other url is done via query params)
